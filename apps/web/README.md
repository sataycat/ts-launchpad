This project was scaffolded by
running [pnpm create vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project) and removing the eslint
related files (since we already have biome)

It roughly follows
the ["Bulletproof react project structure"](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react/blob/master/docs/project-structure.md),
except I call it "modules" instead of "features" to keep it consistent with the backend code.

## Stack
